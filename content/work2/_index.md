UnicornNation currently uses an Oracle Data Warehouse, to store current data from their ticketing system. The IT team has determined that moving this data warehouse to Amazon Redshift would provide better performance and flexibility, at a lower cost.

In this lab, you are going to use AWS Schema Conversion Tool to convert the Oracle database schema to a Redshift Schema. You will be converting a number of tables and views.
